# Fresh GitHub Repository Setup

## Step 1: Create New Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `brilliantcv.ai`
3. Description: `AI-powered job application and CV management platform`
4. Set to **Public**
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we have files to upload)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Complete Project Structure
In the new empty repository, click "uploading an existing file"

### Upload These Folders (drag entire folders):
- **client/** (complete folder with all pages, components, hooks)
- **server/** (complete folder with routes, services, auth)
- **shared/** (complete folder with schema)

### Upload These Individual Files:
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts
- tailwind.config.ts
- drizzle.config.ts
- postcss.config.js
- components.json
- vercel.json
- .gitignore
- replit.md

## Step 3: Commit
- Commit message: "Complete brilliantcv.ai application with all components"
- Click "Commit changes"

## What This Achieves:
✅ Proper folder structure automatically
✅ All 185 lines of server/services/openai.ts
✅ All 47 UI components
✅ All 7 page components
✅ Complete authentication system
✅ Working Stripe integration
✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

The upload should complete in 2-3 minutes and trigger automatic Vercel deployment.
