# GitHub Upload Instructions

Your brilliantcv.ai deployment is failing because the public folder in GitHub is empty. Here are the exact files you need to upload:

## Step 1: Upload index.html to public folder

1. Go to https://github.com/your-username/brilliantcv.ai/tree/main/public
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name it: `index.html`
4. Copy and paste this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1" />
    <script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-Cal7zyEs.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/index-Bx7LCRcy.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

5. Commit the file

## Step 2: Create assets folder and upload CSS file

1. Click "Add file" → "Create new file" 
2. Name it: `assets/index-Bx7LCRcy.css`
3. You'll need the CSS content from your Replit project (65KB file)
4. Commit the file

## Step 3: Upload JavaScript file

1. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Name it: `assets/index-Cal7zyEs.js` 
3. You'll need the JS content from your Replit project (503KB file)
4. Commit the file

## Alternative: Bulk Upload

Instead of creating files one by one:
1. Download the entire `dist/public` folder from your Replit project
2. In GitHub, go to the public folder
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Drag and drop the index.html and assets folder
5. Commit all files

Once these files are uploaded, Vercel will automatically redeploy and your application will be live.
