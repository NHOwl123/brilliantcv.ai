# Deployment Troubleshooting Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Replit: Application runs perfectly in development
- ✅ GitHub: Repository exists with code
- ✅ Vercel: Environment variables configured (9/9 correct)
- ✅ Vercel: Builds complete successfully
- ❌ Vercel: Deployment serves 404 errors
- ❌ GitHub: public folder is empty (missing built files)

## Known Working Components
1. **Replit Development Environment**: Application fully functional
2. **Build Process**: `npm run build` creates dist/public/ with 3 files
3. **Vercel Project**: Environment variables configured correctly
4. **Domain**: brilliantcv.ai points to Vercel

## Identified Breakdown Point
**GitHub Repository Missing Built Files**
- The public folder in GitHub is empty
- Vercel needs index.html and assets/ folder to serve the application
- Built files exist in Replit at dist/public/ but not uploaded to GitHub

## Step-by-Step Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Verify File Transfer (Next Session)
1. **Confirm built files exist in Replit**
   - Check dist/public/index.html
   - Check dist/public/assets/index-*.css and index-*.js
   - Verify file sizes match expected (382B, 65KB, 503KB)

2. **Upload files to GitHub public folder**
   - Method A: Manual upload via GitHub web interface
   - Method B: Copy/paste file contents into new files
   - Method C: Use git commands if connection allows

### Phase 2: Verify Vercel Configuration
1. **Check vercel.json routing**
   - Confirm outputDirectory: "dist/public" 
   - Verify routes point to correct files
   - Test buildCommand runs successfully

2. **Trigger deployment**
   - Wait for Vercel deployment limit reset (13 hours)
   - Or upgrade to Vercel Pro for immediate deployment

### Phase 3: Test Deployment
1. **Verify application loads**
   - Check brilliantcv4-ai.vercel.app returns 200 status
   - Confirm main application interface appears
   - Test basic functionality (signup, navigation)

2. **Switch domain**
   - Point brilliantcv.ai to working deployment
   - Test custom domain functionality

## Contingency Plans

### Plan B: Alternative Deployment
If GitHub → Vercel continues failing:
- Deploy directly from Replit using built-in deployment
- Use alternative hosting (Netlify, Railway)
- Create simplified static deployment

### Plan C: Simplified Build
If complex build continues failing:
- Create minimal static version
- Deploy single-page application
- Add backend features incrementally

## Success Criteria
✅ brilliantcv4-ai.vercel.app loads main application
✅ User can create account and navigate
✅ AI features work with OpenAI integration
✅ Stripe payment system functional
✅ Custom domain brilliantcv.ai working

## Next Session Priority
1. Upload 3 built files to GitHub public folder
2. Trigger Vercel deployment when limit resets
3. Test complete application functionality
