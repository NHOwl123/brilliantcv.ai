# Solution: Bypass Git Lock Issues

## Current Problem
- Git repository has persistent lock files
- Replit prevents removing lock files due to safety restrictions
- Standard git commands fail with lock errors

## Solution: Fresh Start Approach

### Step 1: Create New Replit Project
1. Go to replit.com and create a NEW project
2. Choose "Import from GitHub" 
3. Import from: `https://github.com/NHOwl123/brilliantcv.ai`
4. This creates a fresh project without lock issues

### Step 2: Copy Current Work to New Project
1. Open both projects (current and new)
2. Copy all your current files to the new project:
   - All server/ files (routes.ts, services/, etc.)
   - All client/ files (pages, components, etc.)
   - All configuration files

### Step 3: Push from New Project
1. In the new project, git will work properly
2. Use Version Control panel to commit and push
3. Update Vercel to use the refreshed repository

## Alternative: Force Unlock (Advanced)
If you have system access, you could:
1. Stop all git processes
2. Remove lock files manually
3. Reset git configuration

But the fresh project approach is cleaner and more reliable.
