# GitHub Upload Methods

## Method 1: Download ZIP from Replit (Recommended)
1. Look for **three-dot menu (⋮)** or **hamburger menu** in Replit
2. Find "Download as ZIP" or "Export" option
3. Download the complete project
4. Extract on your computer
5. Upload folders to GitHub using your computer's file browser

## Method 2: Use GitHub CLI in Replit
If available in this Replit:
```bash
gh repo create brilliantcv.ai --public
git add .
git commit -m "Complete application"
git push origin main
```

## Method 3: Individual File Upload
1. In GitHub repository, click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Upload files one by one:
   - First upload all individual config files
   - Then create folders manually and upload contents

## Method 4: Use Compressed File
1. I've created `brilliantcv-complete.zip` 
2. Download this ZIP file from Replit
3. Extract on your computer
4. Upload extracted contents to GitHub

## Files to Upload:
- client/ (60 TypeScript files)
- server/ (routing + 3 services)
- shared/ (schema)
- package.json + 10 config files

The ZIP method is most reliable for getting all 137 files uploaded correctly.
