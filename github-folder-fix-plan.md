# GitHub Folder Structure Fix Plan

## Problem
The main source code folders (client, server, shared) are showing as files instead of folders in GitHub. This prevents Vercel from reading the source code and building the application properly.

## Solution Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Client Folder
1. Delete the "client" file in GitHub
2. Create new file: `client/src/App.tsx` (this creates the folder structure)
3. Upload all client files systematically

### Phase 2: Fix Server Folder  
1. Delete the "server" file in GitHub
2. Create new file: `server/index.ts` (this creates the folder structure)
3. Upload all server files systematically

### Phase 3: Fix Shared Folder
1. Delete the "shared" file in GitHub
2. Create new file: `shared/schema.ts` (this creates the folder structure)
3. Upload shared files

### Phase 4: Trigger Deployment
1. Wait for Vercel deployment limit to reset
2. Or upgrade to Vercel Pro for immediate deployment
3. Test full application functionality

## Critical Files to Upload First

### Client folder priority:
- src/App.tsx (main app component)
- src/main.tsx (entry point)
- src/index.css (global styles)

### Server folder priority:
- index.ts (main server file)
- routes.ts (API routes)
- storage.ts (database layer)

### Shared folder priority:
- schema.ts (database schema)

## Alternative: Fresh Repository
If folder conflicts persist:
1. Create new GitHub repository
2. Upload all files correctly from start
3. Connect new repository to Vercel
4. Update domain settings
